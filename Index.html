 	<p class="princessstory">These wonderful kittens were adopted by Camila Duran. The first one to join the 
 	team was <strong>Princess</strong>. She was found in a donation event. Several things about her made 
 	Camila believe that she would be an amazing addition to her family but the thing 
 	that convinced Camila into adopting Princess was her story. She had come from a very
 	rough past, yet she remained strong and happy.</p>
 	
 	<img src="Images/monster.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="photo of adorable
 	skinny cat" title="monster the skinny cat">
 	<p class="monsterstory">Second one to join the family was <strong>Monster</strong>. Monster belonged to another family
 	before being a part of the Duran family. She was very loved but due to a rough time
 	within the family they could not keep her anymore. At that point she joined our 
 	family. Monster is a very loving cat. She loves to cuddle with humans, dogs and cats
 	.... pretty much anything that would hold her and make her feel loved!</p>
